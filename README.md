# Kentucky Bluegrass Guide

The **Kentucky Bluegrass Guide** is a responsive single‑page web application introducing users to the culture, nature, and cities of Kentucky — especially the Bluegrass Region. It highlights **Frankfort**, **Lexington**, and **Louisville**, combining real‑time data, curated information, and local attractions into a smooth SPA‑style experience.

The app includes current weather, upcoming events, restaurant recommendations, scenic images, and an about section with cultural and natural highlights. Users can save favorite events, images, and restaurants to a personal planner stored locally in the browser. 

This project was created as part of a web development portfolio.

## What I Learned

Working on the Kentucky Bluegrass Guide helped me strengthen both my technical and design skills. 

- **Building a SPA without frameworks**: Managing multiple views using JavaScript by showing and hiding sections dynamically.
- **Integrating external APIs**: Fetching and displaying real‑time data from OpenWeatherMap and Ticketmaster.
- **Using Local Storage for persistent data**: Implementing a planner that saves events, restaurants, and images across sessions.
- **Designing responsive layouts**: Using CSS Grid and flexible layouts to support different screen sizes.
- **Organizing a multi‑file JavaScript project**: Splitting features into separate JS modules for clarity and maintainability.
- **Improving UI/UX details**: Adding “Saved!” button states and hover titles for a more polished feel.
- **Practicing version control**: Committing regularly, structuring a clean repository, and documenting the project clearly.
