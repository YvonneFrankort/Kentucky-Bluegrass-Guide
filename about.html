      <h2>About Kentucky</h2>
      <p>
        Kentucky, also known as the Bluegrass State, is located in the south-central region of the United States of America. 
        Bordered by seven states, it is a land of deep rivers, rolling hills, and fertile valleys. <br>
        Kentucky’s history is shaped by early pioneers, the American frontier, and the rise of agriculture and industry. <br>
        Today, the state is famous for its horse racing and farms, bourbon distilleries, bluegrass music, Appalachian heritage, southern hospitality and scenic landscapes 
        that stretch from the Appalachian Mountains in the east to the Mississippi River in the west.<br>
        From the bustling streets of Kentucky's largest city Louisville to the scenic countryside of Lexington and the historic state capital of Frankfort, 
        Kentucky blends natural beauty with a rich cultural tradition.
      </p>
      <br> 
      <h2>About Bluegrass Region</h2>
      <p>
        Located in central Kentucky, the Bluegrass Region is often considered the heart of the state. 
        The region was named for the long-stemmed grass that flourishes there. 
        Its gently rolling hills, fertile limestone soil, rich tobacco fields and pastures give the land its signature deep green shade.
        This natural environment has made the region the “Horse Capital of the World”, home to world-famous thoroughbred farms and racetracks in Lexington.<br>
        The region also holds a deep cultural and musical heritage — it’s the birthplace of bluegrass and country music, gospel. <br>
        Historic towns such as Lexington and Frankfort preserve the charm of early Kentucky while offering modern life filled with
        art, festivals and Southern cooking.
